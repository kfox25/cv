        <p>In school I had only one real hobby.
         I was obsessed with Shakespeare and became very opinionated about the Poet.
         For eaxmple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>John Gielgud was the best Hamlet.</li>
                <li>Alec Guiness was the best Lear.</li>
                <li>Paul Scofield was the best Othello.</li>
                <li>Anthony Quayle was the best Macbeth.</li>
                <li>Shakespearean Tragedy by AC Bradley is the greatest single book on Shakespeare.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>


        <li>Other stuff I like, in no particular order.</li><br>

            <ul>
                <li>The Pre-Raphealites</li>
                <li>Classic Novels</li>
                <li>The Orchid-Dandelion Hypothesis</li>
                <li>Good cinematography</li>
                <li>The TV series, Rectify</li>
            </ul>
